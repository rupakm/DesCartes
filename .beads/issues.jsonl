{"id":"DesCartes-k9y","title":"Phase 1.2: Convert Server queue processing to ClosureTask","description":"Replace manual ProcessQueuedRequests event scheduling with ClosureTask. This eliminates the need for a separate event variant and makes the intent clearer. Benefits: eliminates event variant, more direct intent, reduces event enum size. Estimated effort: 1-2 hours. Risk: Low.","notes":"After analysis, the current event-based approach is more appropriate than Task conversion. ProcessQueuedRequests is a legitimate component event that represents stateful queue processing, unlike the TowerResponseHandler which was a one-shot operation. The Task system is designed for stateless operations, and converting this would require complex workarounds without clear benefits.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T13:27:39.405738+01:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T13:42:05.411534+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T13:41:50.989108+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"DesCartes-k9y","depends_on_id":"DesCartes-zea","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T13:28:50.946686+01:00","created_by":"rupak"}]}
