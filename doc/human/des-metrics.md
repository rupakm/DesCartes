# `des-metrics`

`des-metrics` contains observability helpers for simulations.

## Goal

Provide a convenient way to collect and report metrics (counters, histograms, etc.) from within simulations so results can be analyzed after the run.

## Notes

Exact metrics integrations vary by crate; see the crate sources and tests for examples.
